Retrocompatibility:

Running a 1.5 quest with Solarus 1.6:
- Keep built-in video mode implementations unchanged,
  including with their automatic window resizing factors.
- Keep sol.video.set_mode() and friends working correctly,
  without deprecation warnings.
- Keep applying the video mode in settings.

Running a 1.6 quest with Solarus 1.6:
- The recommended way is now to use shaders.
- sol.video.set_mode() and friends are now deprecated but still work,
  including their automatic window resizing factors.
- Shaders are not applied if the video mode is not "normal".
- The video mode from settings is now ignored and will no longer be saved.
- Initial window size: quest size x2.
- Changing the shader does not resize the window.

Converting a 1.5 quest to 1.6 with the quest editor:
- Create shaders equivalent to the old built-in video modes.
